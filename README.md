# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## **Welcome to FWB!**

This doc was created to give new members a short guide in getting oriented at FWB

This includes:

* Getting an idea of the culture and etiquette at FWB.
* Getting familiar with the Discord channels.
* Subscribing to the FWB Events calendar.
* Attending your first couple of voice chats in the FWB Discord.

We recommend going through these five steps to get oriented at FWB.

## 1. Read the FWB Culture and Etiquette Guide

We've noticed that new members generally feel like they need to lurk for a bit before starting to interact.

You may find our [code-of-conduct.md](start-here/code-of-conduct.md "mention") a useful guide.

## 2. Check Out The Discord Channel Guide

In the beginning, there was the FWB Discord.

## 4. Attend an FWB New Member Hang

New Member Voice Chat is a monthly voice chat that happens in the FWB Discord to help new members get oriented.

Use chat text to share links and for chat stream.

Don't be shy, raise your hand!

## 5. Attend an FWB Town Hall

These happen bi-weekly in the #fwb-town-hall voice channel. You can think of Town Halls as regular status updates regarding what's going on at FWB, and what's coming up. At the end of the Town Hall, the floor is open. Questions and feedback are encouraged, especially from new members.
