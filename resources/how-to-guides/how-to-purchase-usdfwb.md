You will need an Ethereum wallet set up in order to buy $FWB. If you haven't done that yet, check out [how to set up your Eth wallet here](how-to-set-up-your-first-ethereum-wallet.md). Otherwise, continue with the steps below.
{% endhint %}

### 1. Head to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org).

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that will allow you to trade and list Ethereum-based tokens.

### 2. Connect your wallet

In the top right, you'll see an option that says "Connect to a wallet".

Click it, choose the wallet of your choice, unlock it, and click connect.

### 3. Select $FWB token

Once you are connected, go to the [Swap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) tab.

Click "Select a token" and search for either 'FWB' or by FWB's contract address: [0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x35bd01fc9d6d5d81ca9e055db88dc49aa2c699a8).

### 4. Enter amount

Enter the amount of $FWB you'd like to purchase.

Keep in mind the exchange rate displayed at this stage will not be inclusive of gas + fees, so you will want slightly more ETH available in your wallet than token you want to purchase. Click "Swap".

### 5. Confirm swap details

You will now see a screen that displays gas + fees. Click "Confirm Swap".

### 6. Execute the swap

This will prompt your wallet authorization. Hit "Confirm".
