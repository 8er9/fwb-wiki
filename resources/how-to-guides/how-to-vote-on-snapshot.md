# ðŸ—³ How To Vote on Snapshot

This guide explains how to vote on an FWB proposal that is open for voting on [Snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org). You can check out [FWB's Snapshot page here.](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth)

Decisions within FWB are made using proposals that $FWB tokenholders can vote on. Once the vote has completed, the option(s) that received the most votes or voting power is automatically selected.

Any FWB member can initiate a proposal and do so by engaging with the Proposal Review Committee. A proposal that has been refined to be voted on by the community at large is posted on [Snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org) for a vote.

FWB uses [different types of voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types) for different types of proposals. In this example we'll use the most common voting type: Single choice voting. Each voter selects a single option (e.g. Approve) and the number of $FWB in her wallet equals her voting power.

In order to vote on any proposal you will need at least [$75 FWB in your wallet](https://www.notion.so/How-To-Purchase-FWB-ff43a18ead2043a7813ef24894ee4edb).
